Create your own HTML/CSS/JS in Snowfire
=======================================

This page describes how to customize a Snowfire page with your own layouts, CSS or JS. A great starting point is to create your own snippet. If you are a web designer we'd love to give you an introduction. Feel free to send us an email at support@snowfire.net and we'll help you! You can also schedule a Skype call where we show you how to access the freedom of customizing everything.

Please note that everything in these docs assumes your Snowfire account is using the Inspire canvas which you get by default when creating a new Snowfire account. If you are using an older canvas, please look in the `legacy` folder. Click the "Dev" button inside Snowfire to see which canvas you are using. 


Create & manage your own snippets
=================================

A snippet is a piece of HTML code, referred to as Content Block in the Snowfire UI. All available snippets pops up when you click the add button inside Snowfire. Each theme already got a couple by default (Text, Image, Video etc).

Get started
-----------
First make sure to enable developer mode by opening your Snowfire account, and click your name in the top right corner and choose Settings. Now hit the "enable developer tools" and head over to the [my first snippet guide](https://github.com/Snowfire/docs/blob/master/guides/my_first_snippet.md)
